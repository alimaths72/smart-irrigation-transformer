# Smart Irrigation Requirement Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting irrigation requirements using environmental and soil-related features such as Moisture Index (MOI), temperature, and humidity. A baseline machine learning model and a Transformer-based deep learning model are developed and compared to determine irrigation needs effectively.

The system is designed to follow a complete machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and real-time inference.
## Problem Statement

Efficient water usage is a major challenge in agriculture. Over-irrigation leads to water wastage, while under-irrigation negatively affects crop yield. Traditional irrigation decisions are often based on fixed schedules rather than real environmental conditions.

This project aims to address this problem by using machine learning techniques to predict irrigation requirements based on real-time environmental data.

## Project Objectives

- To analyze environmental and soil-related data relevant to irrigation decisions  
- To develop a baseline machine learning model for irrigation prediction  
- To implement a Transformer-based model for improved performance  
- To compare baseline and deep learning model results  
- To provide a real-time prediction system for irrigation requirements
