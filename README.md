# Smart Irrigation Requirement Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting irrigation requirements using environmental and soil-related features such as Moisture Index (MOI), temperature, and humidity. A baseline machine learning model and a Transformer-based deep learning model are developed and compared to determine irrigation needs effectively.

The system is designed to follow a complete machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and real-time inference.
